# Hi, I'm Tianle Lin.

This is Tianle Lin, A GIS major junior from China. This fall will be my third year at UCSB, and I am excited to meet new people and new friends in the following quarters. Even though it has been a tough period for all of us, I believe that what does not kill you make you stronger. So stay strong and stay tough, may the force be with you!!!
